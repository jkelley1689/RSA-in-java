# RSA-in-java
Java program that decrypts a ciphertext encrypted with a toy version of RSA that uses a small value for n.
This was a final project for a Cryptography class
This program was designed to work with any n <= 100000
The input of your program consists of the public key (n, e) and the ciphertext given as a sequence of numbers.
The public key used for the encryption is n = 18923 and e = 1261
We were only allowed to use the standard java libraries, specifically not allowed to use Crypto or BigInteger
