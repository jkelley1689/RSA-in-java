i became involved in an argument about modern painting a subject upon which i am spectacularly ill informed 
however many of my friends can become heated and even violent on the subject and i enjoy their wrangles in a 
modest way i am an artist myself and i have some sympathy with the abstractionists although i have gone 
beyond them in my own approach to art i am a lumpist twoor three decades ago it was quite fashionable 
to be a cubist and to draw everything in cubes then there was a revolt by the vorticists who drew everything 
in whirls we now have the abstractionists who paint everything in a very abstracted manner but my own small 
works done on my telephone padare composed of carefully shaded strangely shaped lumps with traces of cubismvorticism 
and abstractionism in them for those who possess the seeing eye as a lumpistist and alone.
